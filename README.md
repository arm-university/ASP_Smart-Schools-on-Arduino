# Smart-Schools-on-Arduino
Our Smart Schools resource provides accessible and engaging projects for teachers and learners that utilise the more advanced features of Arduino in real-world contexts. It presents real problems that need solving with technology with all the associated teaching and learning resources such as slides, lesson plans, activities as well as solution guides/cheat sheets for non-specialists. The resources are split into Key Stages (3-5) with 3 courses per key stage.

## Resource Aim
To introduce learners to Arduino and Physical Computing and the Internet of Things, through engaging hands-on, real-world projects.

## Learning Outcomes
- To understand what the Internet of Things is, and how it is enabled by embedded systems
- To understand how to connect electronic components to create physical computing projects
- To understand how Arduino devices and peripherals can be applied to solve real-world problems
- To understand the basics of data analysis and machine learning using Python

## Resource Structure
The course is a series of individual projects that build in complexity. The resources are split across Key Stages (3-5) with 3 projects per key stage.

- Key stage 3 (Middle School) - ages 11-14
- Key stage 4 (High School) - ages 14-16
- Key stage 5 (Seniors) - ages 16-18

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community. We recognise that some of you will be accustomed to using the previous terms and may not immediately recognise their replacements. Please refer to the following examples:

- When introducing the AMBA 3 AHB-Lite Protocols, we will use the term ‘Manager’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Subordinate’ instead of ‘Slave’.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
